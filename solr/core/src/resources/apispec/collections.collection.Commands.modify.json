If a node is not live when the CREATE operation is called, it will not get any parts of the new collection, which could lead to too many replicas being created on a single live node. Defining maxShardsPerNode sets a limit on the number of replicas CREATE will spread to each node. If the entire collection can not be fit into the live nodes, no collection will be created at all."
