Any mistakes found in this documentation after its release will be listed on the on-line version of this page:

//TODO we need to update this URL or make a decision about this page...
//  since we'll have the ability to regen the "hosted" HTML version of the guide,
//  after release, we can always use the verion variable to generate the Errata URL
//  specific to this "version" of the guide...
//        https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/{solr-docs-version}/errata.html
//  ...and/or a URL to the "latest" nightly build of the guide...
//        https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/nightly-draft/errata.html
//  (assuming some URL RewriteRule that maps /solr/guide/nightly/.* to our jenkins build)
